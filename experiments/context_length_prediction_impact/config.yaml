# rather large window covering 5% of different context length to ensure
# predictions have stabilized long term
PREDICTION_VARIANCE_WINDOW_SIZE: 100

# arbitrary value, intuited from statistical p-values: 1e-5
# 0.01 should suffice and is properly interpretable: cumulative variance of prediction less than 1%
